* Typed Racket-Compatible Queue Library
The ~unsafe-typed-data-queue~ package provides a typed wrapper around the
~data/queue~ module in Racket, making it accessible to Typed Racket with correct
typing for enqueuing, dequeuing, and checking queue properties. It introduces
specific types to manage both read and write operations using Racket's ~Parameter~
type to simulate invariant types.

** Installation
You can install the package from the Racket package manager using:
#+begin_src shell
raco pkg install unsafe-typed-data-queue
#+end_src

** Usage
The package provides a typed API for creating and managing queues in Typed Racket.

** Technical Details
Typed Racket currently lacks support for contravariant types in type constructors,
so ~unsafe-typed-data-queue~ relies on a ~Queueof~ struct with ~Parameter~ types
for read and write constraints.

** License
~unsafe-typed-data-queue~ is distributed under the MIT License.
